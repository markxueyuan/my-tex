The value of \textbackslash i is now \i.
% The old program state will be restored completely after returning from the local group.

% \bgroup , ended by \egroup, can also be used to delimit arguments to \hbox or \vbox.
% \bgroup is also useful to test whether the next following character is an open brace.

%  Tex does not know how to write into macros of an outer scope.

{
  \global\def\a{123}
  \global\advance\count0 by 3
  \global\toks0={34}
}
\a \the\count0 \the\toks0
% definition follows \global immediately will be done globally.

\newcount\m
\m = 123

  \globaldefs=1
  \advance\m by 3

\the\m

\m = 123

\m = 123

% globaldefs = 0 is the default.

Here \textbackslash initialvalue is \initialvalue

  % do sth.
  \def\initialvalue{42}
  \global\let\myglobaltemporary=\initialvalue

Now we get this lovely \variable

% what is interesting in code above is that,

% although following is valid: 

\def\v{1}
\edef\v{\v}
Please show me \textbackslash v \v

% but \def\v{\v} \v will lead to an infinite loops which causes stackoverflow
